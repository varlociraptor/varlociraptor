D denotes the edit distance to the ALT allele in case it is higher than what could be expected from sequencing errors (in that case, Varlociraptor derives a third allele from the read sequence and considers that as an alternative to the alt allele, instead of the reference allele), T being the type of alignment, encoded as s=single end and p=paired end, A denoting whether the observations also map to an alternative locus (# = most found alternative locus, * = other locus, . = no locus), S being the strand that supports the observation (+, -, or * for both), O being the read orientation (> = F1R2, < = F2R1, * = unknown, ! = non standard, e.g. R1F2), P being the read position (^ = most found read position, * = any other position or position is irrelevant), X denoting whether the respective alignments entail a softclip ($ = softclip, . = no soft clip), and I denoting indel operations in the respective alignments against the alt allele (* = some indel, . = no indel or information irrelevant for variant type).">

##FORMAT=<ID=SCB,Number=A,Type=String,Description="Softclip bias estimate: $ indicates that ALT allele is associated with with softclips in the same alignment, . indicates that there is no softclip bias. Softclip bias is indicative of systematic alignment errors, cause by a part of the read that does not properly align to the reference (and is thus soft clipped). Note that softclips can also be caused by structural variants. However, structural variants on the same haplotype as e.g. an SNV should not cause a softclip bias, because there will usually still be reads that do not reach the SV, thereby providing evidence against a softclip bias. Probability for softclip bias is captured by the ARTIFACT event (PROB_ARTIFACT).">

Homopolymer error is indicative of systematic PCR amplification errors. Probability for such homopolymer artifacts is captured by the ARTIFACT event (PROB_ARTIFACT).">
##FORMAT=<ID=ALB,Number=A,Type=String,Description="Alt locus bias estimate: * indicates that ALT allele is systematically associated with either MAPQs smaller than the maximum MAPQ or a major alternative alignment (XA tag) reported by the used read mapper. This would be indicative of ALT reads actually coming from another locus (e.g. some repeat, a homology, a distant variant allele, or a CNV). Probability for alt locus bias is captured by the ARTIFACT event (PROB_ARTIFACT).">
