##FORMAT=<ID=SCB,Number=A,Type=String,Description="Softclip bias estimate: $ indicates that ALT allele is associated with with softclips in the same alignment, . indicates that there is no softclip bias. Softclip bias is indicative of systematic alignment errors, cause by a part of the read that does not properly align to the reference (and is thus soft clipped). Note that softclips can also be caused by structural variants. However, structural variants on the same haplotype as e.g. an SNV should not cause a softclip bias, because there will usually still be reads that do not reach the SV, thereby providing evidence against a softclip bias. Probability for softclip bias is captured by the ARTIFACT event (PROB_ARTIFACT).">

Homopolymer error is indicative of systematic PCR amplification errors. Probability for such homopolymer artifacts is captured by the ARTIFACT event (PROB_ARTIFACT).">
##FORMAT=<ID=ALB,Number=A,Type=String,Description="Alt locus bias estimate: * indicates that ALT allele is systematically associated with either MAPQs smaller than the maximum MAPQ or a major alternative alignment (XA tag) reported by the used read mapper. This would be indicative of ALT reads actually coming from another locus (e.g. some repeat, a homology, a distant variant allele, or a CNV). Probability for alt locus bias is captured by the ARTIFACT event (PROB_ARTIFACT).">
