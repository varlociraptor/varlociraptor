# GIAB variant (1:3386594) which is homozygous. In this sample, it can look like strand bias (which is wrong) because of the targeted approach.
# TODO what can we do about this? I'd rather say better we have a bit of missing sensitivity at the boundaries of target regions instead of 
# FPs in the middle.
