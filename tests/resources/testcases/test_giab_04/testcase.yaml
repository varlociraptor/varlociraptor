# GIAB variant (1:3386594) which is homozygous. In this sample, it can look like strand bias (which is wrong) because of the targeted approach.
# We currently fail at detecting the VAF correctly, because the sample contains one read which strongly disagrees with the variant. This
# read could be a mismapper from an homologous region, but its MAPQ is 60 (hence, the homology is likely not properly represented in the reference.
