# False positive from giab sample (confidently called as non-variant in giab).
# This seems like an artifact of low coverage. It would be nice if we have a non-threshold approach to have somehow less strong probs on such low coverage cases.
# It seems like two times the same mismatch is considered too unlikely to be an artifact by the model.
