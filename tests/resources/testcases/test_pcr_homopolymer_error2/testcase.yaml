# Deletion in GIAB sample that is considered to be a PCR induced homopolymer error by the truth.
# Our model thinks this is a true deletion, because the distribution is not symmetric around the site (no insertions).
# TODO: GIAB could be wrong here, would be good to check in a PCR free sample.
# It can also be that the symmetry is violated in this sample, we don't have up-to-date alignment properties for it.

expected:
  # TODO reactivate tests once alignment properties for this sample have been recalculated
  # allelefreqs:
  #   - NA12878 == 0.0
  # posteriors:
  #   - PROB_ARTIFACT < 1.0
