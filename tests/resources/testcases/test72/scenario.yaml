# This scenario is templated with Jinja2 and rendered for each group (see sample sheet).
# A variable `samples` is available, holding the dataframe of
# the sample sheet, filtered to those samples contained in the group to be rendered.
# For example, this can be used to pass arbitrary column values (like the purity below),
# to the sample definitions.
# Note that sample names here must correspond to the alias column in the sample sheet.
