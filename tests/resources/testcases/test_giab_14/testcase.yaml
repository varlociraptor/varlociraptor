# True variant in complicated region in GIAB (1:1920434). This is called as an homopolymer artifact currently.
# The reason is that there are actually homopolymer artifacts on top of this variant, which happen to fit better to the homopolymer error model
# than the wildtype assumption (there are more AA insertions than expected in the wildtype case). It is just bad luck that this looks like an error.
