<h1 id='monte-carlo-integration' class='section-header'><a href='#monte-carlo-integration'>Monte Carlo Integration</a></h1>
<p>This chapter describes routines for multidimensional Monte Carlo integration. These include the traditional Monte Carlo method and adaptive 
algorithms such as VEGAS and MISER which use importance sampling and stratified sampling techniques. Each algorithm computes an estimate of 
a multidimensional definite integral of the form,</p>

<p>I = \int_xl<sup>xu</sup> dx \int_yl<sup>yu</sup>  dy ...  f(x, y, ...)</p>

<p>over a hypercubic region ((x_l,x_u), (y_l,y_u), ...) using a fixed number of function calls. The routines also provide a statistical estimate 
of the error on the result. This error estimate should be taken as a guide rather than as a strict error bound—random sampling of the region 
may not uncover all the important features of the function, resulting in an underestimate of the error.</p>

<h2 id='interface' class='section-header'><a href='#interface'>Interface</a></h2>
<p>All of the Monte Carlo integration routines use the same general form of interface. There is an allocator to allocate memory for control 
variables and workspace, a routine to initialize those control variables, the integrator itself, and a function to free the space when done.</p>

<p>Each integration function requires a random number generator to be supplied, and returns an estimate of the integral and its standard deviation. 
The accuracy of the result is determined by the number of function calls specified by the user. If a known level of accuracy is required this 
can be achieved by calling the integrator several times and averaging the individual results until the desired accuracy is obtained.</p>

<p>Random sample points used within the Monte Carlo routines are always chosen strictly within the integration region, so that endpoint singularities 
are automatically avoided.</p>

<h2 id='vegas' class='section-header'><a href='#vegas'>VEGAS</a></h2>
<p>The VEGAS algorithm of Lepage is based on importance sampling. It samples points from the probability distribution described by the function 
|f|, so that the points are concentrated in the regions that make the largest contribution to the integral.</p>

<p>In general, if the Monte Carlo integral of f is sampled with points distributed according to a probability distribution described by the function 
g, we obtain an estimate E_g(f; N),</p>

<p>E_g(f; N) = E(f/g; N)
with a corresponding variance,</p>

<p>\Var_g(f; N) = \Var(f/g; N).
If the probability distribution is chosen as g = |f|/I(|f|) then it can be shown that the variance V_g(f; N) vanishes, and the error in the 
estimate will be zero. In practice it is not possible to sample from the exact distribution g for an arbitrary function, so importance sampling 
algorithms aim to produce efficient approximations to the desired distribution.</p>

<p>The VEGAS algorithm approximates the exact distribution by making a number of passes over the integration region while histogramming the 
function f. Each histogram is used to define a sampling distribution for the next pass. Asymptotically this procedure converges to the desired 
distribution. In order to avoid the number of histogram bins growing like K<sup>d</sup> the probability distribution is approximated by a separable 
function: g(x_1, x_2, ...) = g_1(x_1) g_2(x_2) ... so that the number of bins required is only Kd. This is equivalent to locating the 
peaks of the function from the projections of the integrand onto the coordinate axes. The efficiency of VEGAS depends on the validity of 
this assumption. It is most efficient when the peaks of the integrand are well-localized. If an integrand can be rewritten in a form which 
is approximately separable this will increase the efficiency of integration with VEGAS.</p>

<p>VEGAS incorporates a number of additional features, and combines both stratified sampling and importance sampling. The integration region 
is divided into a number of “boxes”, with each box getting a fixed number of points (the goal is 2). Each box can then have a fractional 
number of bins, but if the ratio of bins-per-box is less than two, Vegas switches to a kind variance reduction (rather than importance 
sampling).</p>

<p>The VEGAS algorithm computes a number of independent estimates of the integral internally, according to the iterations parameter described 
below, and returns their weighted average. Random sampling of the integrand can occasionally produce an estimate where the error is zero, 
particularly if the function is constant in some regions. An estimate with zero error causes the weighted average to break down and must 
be handled separately. In the original Fortran implementations of VEGAS the error estimate is made non-zero by substituting a small value 
(typically 1e-30). The implementation in GSL differs from this and avoids the use of an arbitrary constant—it either assigns the value a 
weight which is the average weight of the preceding estimates or discards it according to the following procedure,</p>

<p>current estimate has zero error, weighted average has finite error
The current estimate is assigned a weight which is the average weight of the preceding estimates.</p>

<p>current estimate has finite error, previous estimates had zero error
The previous estimates are discarded and the weighted averaging procedure begins with the current estimate.</p>

<p>current estimate has zero error, previous estimates had zero error
The estimates are averaged using the arithmetic mean, but no error is computed.</p>
