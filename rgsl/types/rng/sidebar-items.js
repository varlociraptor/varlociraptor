This is deliberate so that you can switch algorithms without having to change any of your application source code.

Although these generators are widely available individually often they aren’t all available on the same platform. This makes it difficult to write portable code using them and so we have included the complete set of Unix generators in GSL for convenience. Note that these generators don’t produce high-quality randomness and aren’t suitable for work requiring accurate statistics. However, if you won’t be measuring statistical quantities and just want to introduce some variation into your program then these generators are quite acceptable."]],"struct":[["Rng",""],["RngType",""]]});
