<div class='docblock'><p>The functions described above make no reference to the actual algorithm used. This is deliberate so that you can switch algorithms without having
to change any of your application source code. The library provides a large number of generators of different types, including simulation quality
generators, generators provided for compatibility with other libraries and historical generators from the past.</p>

<p>The following generators are recommended for use in simulation. They have extremely long periods, low correlation and pass most statistical tests.
For the most reliable source of uncorrelated numbers, the second-generation RANLUX generators have the strongest proof of randomness.</p>

is known as the “Mersenne Twister” generator. It has a Mersenne prime period of 2<sup>19937</sup> - 1 (about 10<sup>6000)</sup> and is equi-distributed in 623 dimensions.
It has passed the DIEHARD statistical tests. It uses 624 words of state per generator and is comparable in speed to the other generators. The original
generator used a default seed of 4357 and choosing s equal to zero in gsl_rng_set reproduces this. Later versions switched to 5489 as the default seed,
you can choose this explicitly via gsl_rng_set instead if you require it.</p>
