Hermite interpolation constructs polynomials which also match first derivatives dy/dx which are provided in the array dya also of length size. The first derivatives can be incorported into the usual divided-difference algorithm by forming a new dataset z = {x_0,x_0,x_1,x_1,...}, which is stored in the array za of length 2*size on output. On output the divided-differences of the Hermite representation are stored in the array dd, also of length 2*size. Using the notation above, dd[k] = [z_0,z_1,...,z_k]. The resulting Hermite polynomial can be evaluated by calling gsl_poly_dd_eval and using za for the input argument xa."],["poly_dd_init","This function computes a divided-difference representation of the interpolating polynomial for the points (x, y) stored in the arrays xa and ya of length size.
